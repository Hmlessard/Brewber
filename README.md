## Introduction
---------------

BrewberEats is great for anyone who is looking to search for, and try new breweries by location.  If they get hungry, they can also view where restaurants are in their local area.

## User Story
-------------

As a USER, I want to be able to enter a city and pull up a list of breweries in the area. WHEN list of breweries displays, it will be on individual cards on the screen, showing the brewery's name, brewery type, address and phone number, if available. WHEN allowing the website to use my location, I can then push a button THEN pins of restaurants near me will display on a map.

## User Instructions
--------------------
1. Click on pop up window to allow website to use your location
2. Confirm whether you are at least age 21 or not
3. Type a city in the "Search for City" text box and hit "Search" button
4. Breweries with their individual info will display on screen
5. Click "I'm Hungry" button and a map will appear with pins of restaurants in your area.
